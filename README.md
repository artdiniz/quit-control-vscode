# Quit Control


Do you hate the fact that `⌘W` or `CTRL+W` closes VSCode if there are no files open ? This extension is for you !

Do you hate mistyping `⌘Q` and shutdowns VSCode with all your unsaved and beloved work ? This extension is for you !

This extension will make all "quitish" keyboard shortcuts prompt you if you really want to close everything if they were going to do so.

## Features

If there is an opened file, `⌘W` and `CTRL+W` will close it as usual. But if there is no file opened, instead of closing the window we will prompt you first.

If you hit `⌘Q` at any moment we will prompt you first
